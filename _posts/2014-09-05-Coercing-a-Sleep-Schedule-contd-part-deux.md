title: Coercing a Sleep Schedule (cont'd part deux)
---

Not to preemptively declare victory or anything, but SUCCESS!!!

Well, it's only been 2 weeks, but still. Last week (week 1), I found that although my wake-up time was moving earlier, to about 10AM, I wasn't getting to sleep any earlier. And one day, I screwed the pooch entirely and slept to my old bad wake-up time of noon. Some of my confidence in the experiment was flagging.

What kept me buoyed was an unexpected, emergent and organic phenomenon: structure. By the end of the week, my mornings were following a predictable pattern:

*   drink coffee that robot coffee maker was so kind as to brew me, while I start to pick up on work where I'd left off the night before, or browse the internet for news, or start-and-not-finish blog entries.
*   on finishing coffee, commence a 30-minute workout in front of the teevee (watching only the most stimulating of content, natch).
*   breakfast

More exercise has been a goal alongside a more normal sleep schedule for a long time now, but I did not anticipate that endeavoring to achieve one would help with the other. Up until this experiment, I was on average working out once a week. Now I'm daily craving the vitality it gives. This convenient dovetailing has to do with a few things.

First, I'm mentally useless in the first couple of hours of the day, so I may as well focus on body over mind.  But more to the point, the time between when I wake up now and when I used to wake up still feels like "secret magical found time", that I can use for whatever purpose I see fit. Previously, I'd wake up and feel Late For Everything, even if I really didn't have anywhere to go or anything time-sensitive in my day. I would therefore feel the need to act productive ASAP, even if that just meant staring at my computer screen for 90 minutes. Last, I believe the exercise is helping me get tired at night, helping to perpetuate the whole she-bang.

So this week, I've screwed no pooches, woken up at the time I set each day, and have even found myself getting to bed earlier, by about an hour or two. I won't declare victory after only a couple weeks, but I'm certainly feeling optimistic.
