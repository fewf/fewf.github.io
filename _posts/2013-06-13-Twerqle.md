Ever played the board game Qwirkle? It's a Scrabble-like game, however it lacks a board--the playing area is bound only by the playing surface. Players take turn making lines, using tiles which each display a colored shape--the particular color and shape each being one of six possibilities. Instead of lines being made up of words, like in Scrabble, in Qwirkle lines are series of tiles either of the same color but different shape, or vice-versa, same shape different color. here's an example. More info about the game for the curious, at the bottom of this entry.

This is a screenshot, btw, of [Twerqle](http://www.galtman.com/twerqle/ "Twerqle"), my Qwirkle clone for the web. Hat tip goes out to [Scott Feeney](http://www.scott.mn "Scott Feeney"), a fellow [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com "Hacker School")er, who walked me through implementing Browserify to lay the groundwork for the game, and continued to give feedback throughout. You can play Twerqle [here](http://www.galtman.com/twerqle/ "TWERQLE"). It's a work-in-progress, but it should be pretty intuitive. Six is the magic number in Qwirkle (six colors, six shapes, six tiles in a rack, max six-length lines, six-point bonus for finishing a line), but not necessarily in Twerqle. You can go from as little as 3 (great for kids!), to 12 (totally mindscrabbling!) and all those sixes turn to the number of your choice. Some extremely fun programming challenges emerged as the game was made, and I'll be returning to the blog to talk about them in no particular order:


\*   Separating game state entirely from the (most jQuery) UI.


\*   The 'zoom' capability.


\*   Combining jQuery draggable and sortable


\*   The biggie: programming the computer player, and the optimization thereof.


\*   Easy mobile web readiness.

The game is a testament to Hacker School, and how much one can grow there. I walked into Hacker School not sure of what I wanted to focus on there, and with only the most awkward handle on Javascript; at the end of 3 short months though, this was an arduous but completely doable undertaking.

So please: play it now and play it often. Let me know, perhaps in the comments here, if you run into any unexpected behavior. If you get bored of playing, try setting the computer to play itself and just watch the generative art emerge, like thus:

More info: Scoring is identical to Scrabble if all the tiles were worth 1. Meaning you get one point for each tile in each line you created or added onto in your turn. So for instance in that image above, the first play may have been the fuchsia diamond, oval and starburst and scored 3 points for that player. Then the next player could have placed the triangle at the end of that line and then pivoted into a new triangle line taking a cool 7 points; 4 for the now 4-length fuchsia line plus 3 for new triangle line, the pink triangle is scored twice. Finally, the green like could have been added, similar to making 2-letter words in Scrabble, scoring 5 points. When a player places the sixth and final tile onto a line (i.e., the last green shape or the last color of triangle), that player scores a 6-point bonus. The game ends when the first person runs out of tiles, and that player get a 6-point bonus for going out.
