title: Coercing A Sleep Schedule
---


I've dealt all my life with a sleep schedule that's shifted into the daytime roughly four hours from what is considered "normal". Left to my own, I tend to stay up until 4 AM and sleep up til noon (ok, occasionally later). Did you know my name (which is Greg, hi, nice to meet you) derives from the Greek for "Watchful, alert"? From this I've concluded some supreme logic of the universe commands me to keep my peepers peeled as most of society snoozes.

And you've got a nightmare when you combine this proclivity with a job that I do from home, much on my own schedule. Even when I'm working on things coordinated with people who are on-site, that site is in California--meaning however early it's happening, it's 3 hours earlier for them than for me.

Even though I'm writing this edit at 3 AM, I am committed to bringing my sleep schedule back at least 1 hour. I've tried to fix it before, with varying degrees of success before an eventual and complete regression. But I've never tried it with my new secret weapon:

See that clock at the bottom? This sentient coffee maker knows what time it is, and when I should be rousing. And in its wisdom, it brews me some of my fresh home-roasted coffee, giving my slugabed ass a reason to wake up.

The idea's so simple you may be asking why I hadn't tried it before. Oh, I've thought of it--but quickly thought twice because of the coffee sins required. For starters, I must grind the coffee up to 8 hours before brewing--the horror! Secondly, I haven't found any known hacks for disabling the coffee maker's <del>burning</del> warming plate. The teensy screws underneath holding the thing together are tightened beyond my puny fingers' 
mettle. I've placed a few nickels on the plate to remove the carafe slightly from its otherwise unavoidable fate.

This experiment has only run for a couple days now; but so far, so good. I'll keep this blog updated on the plan's success as an added bit of structure for my morning.
