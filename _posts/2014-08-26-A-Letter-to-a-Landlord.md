title: A Letter to a Landlord
---

> Hello Yvette,
> 
> Thank you for talking to the owners of the building and convincing them not to raise our rent if we decide to stay for another year. You did that fast, like almost too fast--can I go back and ask for the rent to actually be lowered?
> 
> I'll discuss it with my housemates--but it's still not a sure thing we're staying. This happens to be the second week with inconsistent availability of hot water. We've called the maintenance guy repeatedly, and the last time he informed us that the machine is under repair and that he's trying to do it when people won't need it.
> 
> Look, we're not crybabies. We understand that things sometimes require maintenance. We understand that that means not having 100% availability of basic services. And we'd also perfectly understand and appreciate an e-mail blast that says "We're working on it. It'll be done by xx/xx. Hot water will be unavailable between x o'clock and y o'clock." That's it.

/end rant.
